#### Steps
1. Create a SQL table by running `scripts/sql_scripts.sql`
2. Complete your `.env`. Note that you should set `LOCAL_DB=true` for local running, and omit this env variable entirely in prod.
3. `yarn`
4. cd into `node_modules/ramsesexchange-v3-sdk` and run `yarn build`. This is necessary as this repo was from github.
5. `npx tsc`
6. Run `bot.js` to start the telegram bot and run `notifier.js` to start the notification service.
